        "This  project corresponds to the final task of the course Machine Learning with Python offered by the Institute for Continuing Education in Science. The team will take the role of data scientists for an exclusive Hotel in the Bahamas. The goal is to screen applying Russian clients. The reason is that Russian clients represent a contrasting customer segment. On one hand, they spend a high quantity of money during their stay in the hotel. On the other hand, they also cause a high cost on damages that is not recoverable for the Hotel. \n",

        "The work was divided in five points, following the recommendation of the professor. The different parts included: prepare the data set, predict the projected revenue per clients, predict which clients will cause damage, predict the damage that those clients would cause, and to create a measure of the expected value for each potential customer so that client list can be selected. \n",

This data set included variables such as profit, damage (from visits that excluded the last one), age , gender, among others. In the next sections more details will be discussed over the different parts of the work. "

As they represented the scores of the clients, it was decided that instead dropping them, a mean imputation (as they were quantitative data), was chosen. Mean imputations were also chosen for the rest of th missing data. "
